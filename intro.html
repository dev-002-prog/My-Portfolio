                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <div class="myintro">I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree at Gyan Ganga
                    Institute of Technology and Sciences. My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in
                    technology, and I am committed to continually expanding my knowledge and skills to stay at the
                    forefront of this rapidly evolving field. Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong passion
                    for programming and problem-solving, which motivates me to continuously learn and take on new
                    challenges.<br><br>I completed my schooling at St. Joseph's Convent Senior Secondary School, where I
                    excelled academically, securing a score of 90.2% in the 12th CBSE board exams. This achievement has
                    instilled in me a strong work ethic and the drive to pursue excellence in everything I do.<br><br>My
                    technical expertise spans multiple programming languages and technologies, including proficiency in

                <h3>1. Truth and Dare game</h3>
                The Truth and Dare Game is a web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It
                replicates the classic party game, allowing players to choose between "Truth" or "Dare," with random
                challenges or questions generated dynamically. <br>

                This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, combining interactive JavaScript logic
                with a visually appealing and user-friendly design crafted using HTML and CSS. It reflects my ability to
                create engaging and functional web applications. <br><br>

                <h3>2. Rock Paper and Scissors game</h3>
                The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a simple yet engaging web application developed using HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript. It brings the classic hand game to the digital platform, offering an interactive and
                enjoyable user experience. <br>

                The game allows players to compete against the computer by selecting one of the three options: Rock,
                Paper, or Scissors. The JavaScript logic determines the winner based on the traditional rules, while
                HTML structures the game, and CSS enhances its visual appeal. <br>

                This project highlights my ability to implement game logic, create interactive features, and design an
                intuitive user interface, reflecting my proficiency in front-end web development. <br> <br>
                <h3>3. Amazon Clone</h3>

                recreation of the website's layout and design elements. <br>

                Key features include a structured navigation bar, product listing sections, and a responsive design that
                ensures compatibility across different devices. This project emphasizes my attention to detail and
                ability to translate complex interfaces into clean and functional code using only HTML and CSS. <br>

                It serves as a testament to my web design skills and demonstrates my capability to work on projects that
                require precision, creativity, and an understanding of user-centric design principles. <br><br>
